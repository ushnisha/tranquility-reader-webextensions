# Tranquility Reader

Tranquility Reader is a Firefox extension that improves the readability 
of web articles.

Tranquility removes unnecessary elements in a webpage, and provides 
a simple and tranquil reading experience. Similar functionality is 
available through Readability or iReader or "Reader Mode" in Firefox. 
Please try the built in "Reader Mode" first and then consider 
Tranquility Reader only if some of the features available only in 
Tranquility Reader are critical for you.

## To use tranquility you can:

* Click on the navigation-bar icon to transform the page in the Desktop Version
* Select the "Tranquility!" menu option from the toolbar menu on Android


## Features:

* Compatible with NoScript

* Save content offline for reading later. The tranquility view is 
  saved locally on your computer

* Ability to export/import the offline content.

* Ability to customize default font, font-size, font color, 
  background color, and width of the reading area (you can use 
  [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to pick a
  suitable color code - thanks to user JA for feedback on this)

* Create and manage your own preset configuration of the various 
  options/preferences

* Add/edit notes/annotations to portions of the offline content; 
  collate annotations with context for a summary of all your 
  notes and annotations.

* Unobtrusive Menu at the bottom of the screen (displayed on 
  clicking on the (+) symbol on the bottom right corner of the 
  screen) provides additional features

* Additional links are now available through a "More Links" button 
  in the Menu at the bottom of the screen

  the link URL in the Tranquility view in the current tab

  and then running Tranquility (right click context menu
